This is a react based fully functional (full stack) website.
I have implemented CRUD operation in this project,
There is also test payment procedure set up in this project.
There are roles for both admin and customer in this project,
i.e after login the dashboard page is unique for admin & customer..
An admin can add another email & make that email-user admin,
an admin can also check all the users order and change their order status.
An User/customer can add review about this service project, buy a service, check their order list etc.
This is the client side code which is deployed to firebase.
